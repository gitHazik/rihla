# MoodQuran

I built **MoodQuran**, an AI-powered application designed to bridge the gap between mental well-being and faith. In a fast-paced world, finding the exact verse that speaks to immediate emotional distress like burnout or anxiety can be overwhelming. MoodQuran removes this friction. Using Groq's lightning fast LLM inference within Supabase Edge Functions, the app analyzes a user's emotional state via an interactive "MoodChat" and instantly curates highly relevant Quranic verses. To guarantee absolute text authenticity, the AI never hallucinates scripture; instead, it generates verse keys to fetch verified Arabic text, translations, and recitation audio directly from the official Quran Foundation APIs. Beyond chat, the app fosters active reflection (Tadabbur) through structured 7-day learning "Journeys" and private journaling, seamlessly syncing saved verses and notes back to the user’s main QF account. Built with React and Tailwind, MoodQuran transforms moments of distress into profound spiritual connection.
